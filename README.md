# mta-sts service

This is the mta-sts endpoint. Since mta-sts does not require existence of individual domain names, I'll be using this repo to build Cloudflare Pages, and then point `mta-sts.$domain` to the cf-pages.

Currently undecided what to do with migadu-hosted/cloudflare-redirected mails, thoughâ€¦
